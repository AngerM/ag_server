# Armeria+Guice Server
This is an opinionated set of Kotlin/Java components that combine [Armera](https://armeria.dev/) and [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice) as well as a few other libraries and utilites in a way I think make sense.

You can selectively use the parts you want or add in your own modules and config as desired.
