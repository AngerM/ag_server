# Armeria+Guice Server ![Tests](https://github.com/AngerM/ag_server/actions/workflows/cd.yml/badge.svg)

### WARNING: Under heavy active development right now. Interfaces/Class names are *not* stable

This is an opinionated set of Kotlin/Java components that combine [Armeria](https://armeria.dev/), [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice) and a few other libraries and utilites in a way I think make sense.

You can selectively use the parts you want or add in your own modules and config as desired.

See the example folder for a simple example. The Dockerfile also builds the example app

Available currently on my github maven repo: https://github.com/AngerM/maven
